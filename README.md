A very flexible and easy-to-use macropad for HELLDIVERS&trade; 2 for live configuration on each drop into combat with individual loadouts.

> [!NOTE]
> **The software requires this specific device [JC3248W535](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DneMCLR)**

Get the game on [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/) or [PS5&trade;](https://www.playstation.com/games/helldivers-2/)

Based on an affordable IoT platform device with a capacitive touchscreen it's very handy for a PC or PS5&trade; since it's connected via Bluetooth or USB as a keyboard input device.

## Instructions

> [!TIP]  
> For instructions to get your own device and installation - please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/unic8s/hd2_macropad/wiki)
> There you will also find lots of details and how to configure and use the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The device is only able to connect to the PS5&trade; via USB.
> It's not able to connect to the PS5&trade; via Bluetooth directly.
> We're currently working on the [BT2USB bridge](https://github.com/unic8s/bt2usb_bridge) which plugs into the USB port of a PS5&trade; directly and connects to the HD2 Macropad via Bluetooth.
